IPL Dataset Analysis – GP Project

This project analyzes IPL (Indian Premier League) data to extract insights, player performance metrics, and trends using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The dataset primarily contains batting statistics of IPL players for the 2025 season.

📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset IPL2025Batters.csv includes player-level statistics such as:

1.Player Name

2.Matches Played

3.Runs Scored

4.Strike Rate

5.Average

6.Boundaries (4s and 6s)

7.Contribution % to Team

🔍 Key Analysis Performed

✔ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Player Performance Ranking (based on runs, strike rate, and contribution %)
✔ Team-wise contribution calculations
✔ Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn

📈 Sample Visualizations

Some example charts generated in this project include:

Top 10 run-scorers bar chart

Strike rate distribution histogram

Team-wise contribution pie chart

Player impact score rankings

📦 Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:

1.pandas

2.numpy

3.matplotlib

4.seaborn

(These are already listed in requirements.txt.)

🚀 Future Work

Extend dataset with bowling and fielding stats

Build predictive models (e.g., player performance forecasting)

Create an interactive Streamlit/Dash dashboard for IPL insights
